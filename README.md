## Hi there 👋

I'm Marek a generalist (aka a “full stack” developer) who can develop React frontends and NodeJS backends in TypeScript. I'm interested in digital accessibility (a11y), responsive and slick UI/UX, and performance.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a recipe manager
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Remix and TypeScript
